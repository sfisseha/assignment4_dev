### Question 1

> Give two possible chatroom moderation features and the reasons that you should implement each one

>Two possible chatroom moderation features can be 
>1) Putting restriction on certain content such as bad words, links or disturbing images. This will help create a more safe space environment for conversations/discussions to flourish with minimal insults and unessary bad words. 
>2) Require a login to enter any given chatroom. This will help remove anonymity which some may have used to troll or aggrevate people without having their name attached to the message.

## Database Setup
> Used Mongodb
